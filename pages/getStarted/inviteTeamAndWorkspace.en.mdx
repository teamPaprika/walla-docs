- Team members in the same team may use different workspaces that won't have access to workspaces they're not part of
- If you want to share a workspace with team members:

### 1. Add team members directly to the workspace
 - This allows the new member to be added to the workspace automatically.

### 2. Invite new members to the team first, and then add manually to the workspace
- In both cases, invited team members cannot view other workspaces to which they do not have access.
- Invite your colleagues to teams and workspaces to collaborate! üôÜüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

    ### When a new team member clicks 'Join', the invitation is complete.

    - With just the team invitation, only your workspace is visible.

        'Decline', their name will be
        automatically removed from the 'Invited Members' list.**</Callout>

    ### Once you send an invitation, members will receive the following invitation to join the workspace.
    - When you accept the invitation from the email, you'll be directed to the workspace. Afterward, you can check the
    invitation from the 'Notifications' icon in the top right corner. You can also directly accept the invitation by
    entering the workspace, clicking on the notification icon, and accepting the invite.

    - Even if members haven't been invited to the team, other workspace members can directly invite others to the team
    and workspace from the workspace. By clicking 'Invite' in the modal below, those members will be invited to both the
    team and workspace at once.
