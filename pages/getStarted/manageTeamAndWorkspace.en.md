# Manage Team or Workspace


> ⚠️ **Team Feature is a higher-level concept than a workspace. (Team > Workspace > Project > Team members)**
> 
> - Team members in the same team may use different workspaces that won't have access to workspaces they're not part of
> - If you want to share a workspace with team members:
>     1. Add team members directly to the workspace 
>         - This allows the new member to be added to the workspace automatically
>     2. Invite new members to the team first, and then add manually to the workspace
>     
>     ⇒ In both cases, invited team members cannot view other workspaces which they do not have access.

> You can update team details like name, profile picture, and workspace names 🙆🏻‍♀️
