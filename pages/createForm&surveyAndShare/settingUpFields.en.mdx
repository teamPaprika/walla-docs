    #### Are you finding it difficult to use the 'Response Validation' feature? Let me explain the concept briefly.

    1. In the 'Response Type', determine how to restrict the responses entered by respondents.
    - For instance, if you want the response to be entered only as a number.
    - Or if you want it to be entered only as text.
    - Or if you want to limit the length of the response.
    - Or if you want to restrict the response format using regular expressions.
    2. The 'Response Condition' adds specific conditions to the response restrictions determined in the 'Response Type.
    - If you've restricted the response type to 'Length', in the response condition, you can set conditions for minimum
    and maximum character counts.
    3. In 'Response Reference', you write down the exact characters, numbers, or regular expressions to specify detailed
    restriction criteria.
    - If you pick 'Length' as the response type and set 'Number' in the response condition, entering '45' in the
    reference value means respondents must provide answers with at least 45 characters to submit.
    - In the 'Error Message' section, you write a warning message that will appear if respondents' answers don't meet
    the conditions you've set.


    #### Here are some commonly used settings for 'Response Validation'.
    1Ô∏è‚É£ I want to set the minimum response length to 45 characters!
    - Response Type: Length
    - Response Condition: Number
    - Reference Value: 45
