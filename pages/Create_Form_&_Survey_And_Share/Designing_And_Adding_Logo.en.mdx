    ### Add 'Fields' that you want to add to your form, and write down your questions and explanations.

    expression) and error messages.
    ### You can visually see how the survey will progress by viewing the 'Logic'.
    - By clicking the 'Logic based on answers' button, you can set different questions based on the answers given.
    ### In the 'Settings,' you can edit the survey's color, and add brand logo, and hidden fields.
    ### Through the 'Ending Field', you can specify that upon survey completion, respondents are redirected to a
    designated URL or shown an exit page (available from the Pro plan onwards).
    ### Once edits of the project are finished, press 'Publish' Button to start receiving responses.
    - Pressing 'Publish' activates the 'Accept Responses' button, allowing respondents to submit their responses. You
    can deactivate the project if you want to stop receiving responses.
