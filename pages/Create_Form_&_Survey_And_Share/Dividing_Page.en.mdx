💡 What are the differences between 'Multiple Fields' and 'Page Break'?

|   | Multiple Fields | Page Break |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Logic per question | X | O |
| Options per question | X | O |

- Multiple fields themselves are a single question, so you can't set logic for each question within multiple fields.
- Page break allows you to freely add logic to questions between separators.

|   | Multiple Fields | Page Break |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Step view | O | X |

- Multiple fields can display several questions on one page in step view.
- Page break is not applied in step view, so you can view one question at a time.

|   | Multiple Fields | Page Break |
| --- | --- | --- |
| List view | X | O |

- Multiple fields are not distinguished from other questions in the list view.
- Page break allows you to flip through separated pages in the list view.

⇒ 'Page Break + List View' is similar to 'Multiple Fields + Step View', but further allows you to set different options or add logic to each question.
