1. Please add a payment field.

2. Enter the necessary information for the payment.

a. **Variant Key**: A unique value that distinguishes the payment UI, displayed in blue in the payment field as <span style={{ color: '#337EA9' }}>Check the Payment UI Variant Key</span>

 - If you insert the live UI, actual payments will be processed. If you insert the test UI, no real payments will be made, so be sure to differentiate when entering.
 - If you’re just starting, you can click the ‘Add UI’ button to configure various payment UIs.
  - After clicking the 'Add UI' button, select 'Domestic General Payment.'

 - Virtual accounts cannot be used.
  - Be sure to **uncheck** virtual accounts in [Features] - [Payment Methods List] within the payment UI editor.
  - Walla records a payment as completed once a response is submitted, but virtual accounts do not process payments instantly. This means that respondents may not complete the payment after submitting the form. As a result, it could appear in the response sheet that the payment was made, even though no money was actually transferred. To ensure proper payment, make sure to uncheck virtual accounts.

b. **Client Key, Secret Key**: The client and secret keys can be found on the Toss Payments Developer Center (https://developers.tosspayments.com/) under 'My Development Information' or <span style={{ color: '#337EA9' }}>by checking the payment widget integration key</span>, which is displayed in blue in the payment field.

 - On the left, select your store and copy the client and secret keys for that store.

c. **Order ID**: A unique value is issued to identify the ordered payment, displayed in the format 'OrderID_RandomKey_Time.'
 - If you’re creating an order form for fish-shaped bread, you can freely generate order IDs like 'redbean' for red bean fish-shaped bread or 'chouxcream' for custard cream fish-shaped bread.
d. **Product Name**: The name of the product the respondent will order.
 - For a fish-shaped bread order form, product names could be 'Red Bean Fish-shaped Bread' or 'Custard Cream Fish-shaped Bread.'
e. **Product Price**: The price of the product the respondent will order.

3. Now you can create an order form using the payment field.
 - If you duplicate a payment field, the secret key will not be duplicated. Please re-enter it in the duplicated field.
 - When using the test UI, real payments will not be processed, so be sure to differentiate from the live UI.
 - You can use logic to show different payment fields based on the respondent's choices.
 - Check out an example survey to quickly see the payment field in action. https://walla.my/v/PaJl6AmkXUW5NRsVoNQT
