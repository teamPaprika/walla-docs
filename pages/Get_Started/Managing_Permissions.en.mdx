## Overview of Permissions

<Callout type='warning' emoji="‚ö†Ô∏è">**Granting permissions to team members is available from the Enterprise plan onwards.**</Callout>
<Callout type='warning' emoji="‚ö†Ô∏è">**Team Feature is a higher-level concept than a workspace. (Team ‚û°Ô∏è Workspace ‚û°Ô∏è
    Project ‚û°Ô∏è Team members)**</Callout>

- Team members in the same team may use different workspaces that won't have access to workspaces they're not part of
- If you want to share a workspace with team members:

### 1. Add team members directly to the workspace
 - This allows the new member to be added to the workspace automatically.

### 2. Invite new members to the team first, and then add manually to the workspace
- In both cases, invited team members cannot view other workspaces to which they do not have access.
- Invite your colleagues to teams and workspaces to collaborate! üôÜüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

## Managing Permissions

<Callout type='warning' emoji="‚ö†Ô∏è">**Permissions are divided into Admin and Member.**</Callout>

- In 'Member Management', you can set each team member as 'Admin' or 'Member'.
- Additionally, in 'Permission Management', you can configure the detailed permissions for 'Admin' and 'Member'.

<Steps>
    ### To manage a team member's permissions, the member must be invited to the workspace. Invitations to the team and workspace can be found [here](/Get_Started/Invite_Team_And_Workspace).
