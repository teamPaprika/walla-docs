- Team members in the same team may use different workspaces that won't have access to workspaces they're not part of
- If you want to share a workspace with team members:

### 1. Add team members directly to the workspace
 - This allows the new member to be added to the workspace automatically.

### 2. Invite new members to the team first, and then add manually to the workspace
- In both cases, invited team members cannot view other workspaces to which they do not have access.
- Invite your colleagues to teams and workspaces to collaborate! üôÜüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
