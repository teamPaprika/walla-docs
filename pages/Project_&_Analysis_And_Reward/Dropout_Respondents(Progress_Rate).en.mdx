<Callout type='info' emoji="ðŸ””">'Dropout respondents' allows you to check where respondents dropped out of the form and how far they progressed.</Callout>

1. You can check the progress rate through 'Dropout respondents' at the bottom of the 'Analytics' tab.
    - The dropout respondents table has different meanings depending on the color.
        - Blue: The respondent visited this question.
        - Light blue: The respondent did not visit this question.
        - Red: The respondent dropped out at this question.
    - Let's look at some examples:
        - <strong style={{color: 'blue'}}>Blue</strong>-Light blue-Light blue-<strong style={{color: 'red'}}>Red</strong>: Moved from question 1 to question 4 via logic and then dropped out.
        - <strong style={{color: 'red'}}>Red</strong>-<strong style={{color: 'blue'}}>Blue</strong>-Light blue-<strong style={{color: 'blue'}}>Blue</strong>: Visited questions 1 and 2, then moved to question 4 via logic and dropped out at question 1.
