<Callout type='info' emoji="ðŸ””">**K-Means Clustering** categorizes responses into several groups based on similarity,
    without requiring separate classification criteria.</Callout>

<Steps>
    ### Please select the item you want to classify.
    - Only responses to items with short answer, long answer, numerical, and subjective table questions can be analyzed.

    ### Select how many clusters you want to create.
    - You can classify into a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 20 clusters.

    ### You can review the results with a Venn diagram and scatter plot graph.
    - The Venn diagram allows you to see the proportion of each response cluster.
    - The scatter plot graph enables you to compare the relationship between each response cluster.

    ### In the subjective response cards on the dashboard, you can primarily review the content and response time of the
    answers.
