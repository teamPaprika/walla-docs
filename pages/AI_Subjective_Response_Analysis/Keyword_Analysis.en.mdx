    ### Choose the search score filter and the number of results.
    - You can set the accuracy of the analyzed keywords using the search score filter. (For example, if you set the
    filter to 0.3, only responses with an accuracy of 0.3 or higher will be displayed.)
    - The number of results refers to the number of responses to be analyzed. (For instance, if you set the number of
    results to 100, it will classify responses containing the keyword in 100 responses.)

    ### Please enter the keyword.
    - You can obtain results by entering not only individual words but also descriptions of entire sentences and
    contexts.
    - Even if there are typos in each response, the search is still possible.
